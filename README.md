# ESP-App
ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) app for FPS and TPS games.

How to Inject and Install the ESP App in an FPS/TPS Game:
1️⃣ Build the React Application
First, you need to build the ESP React app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm run build
This will generate a /build folder with all the necessary static assets.

2️⃣ Convert to Overlay Injection
To inject into a game, you need to:

Wrap the app in an overlay that can be drawn on top of a game window.

Use tools like Electron, CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework), or Overlay frameworks (like overlay.exe).

Example: Using Electron:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install electron --save
npx electron .
Create a main.js:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createWindow() {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    frame: false, // Makes it frameless
    transparent: true, // Transparency for overlay
    alwaysOnTop: true, // Overlay over game
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
    },
  });

  win.loadFile('build/index.html');
  win.setIgnoreMouseEvents(false);
}

app.whenReady().then(createWindow);
3️⃣ Inject into the Game (DLL Injection)
To access game memory and display ESP:

Use a DLL Injector (like GH Injector or Extreme Injector).

Write a C++ DLL that:

Hooks the game rendering loop (DirectX, OpenGL, or Vulkan).

Draws the ESP overlay.

Communicates with your Electron app to get entity positions and data.

4️⃣ Communication Layer (Optional but Recommended)
You may need a layer for real-time data from the game:

Memory Reading Libraries: Use Cheat Engine to find offsets and ReadProcessMemory for entity data.

WebSockets or IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to pass real-time coordinates from your app to the overlay.

5️⃣ Usage
Launch the game.

Run your ESP Overlay (Electron App).

Inject the DLL.

The overlay will show entity positions, health, loot, and more.

6️⃣ (Optional) Anti-Cheat Bypass
Most online FPS/TPS games have anti-cheat (like BattleEye, Easy Anti-Cheat):

Running this ESP app without a bypass can result in a ban.

For educational purposes only—bypassing anti-cheat is not recommended or legal in most game TOS.
